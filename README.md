Chair.HQ is a wheelchair control panel designed for discomfort management. At its core its a Raspberry Pi Zero with a touch display and a rotary knob. We envision it being used by wheelchair users and researchers alike. It can be used to control and monitor devices made for the wheelchair or its user and can also be used in diary studies for research. It is currently used to control Loop One, a prototype developed for temperature regulation.
